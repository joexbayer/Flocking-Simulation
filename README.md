# Flocking Simulation
 Flocking simulation and visualization.<br>
 
Working Demo: <a href="https://joexbayer.github.io/Flocking-Simulation/" target="_blank">Click here!</a>

<br>
 Basic models of flocking behavior are controlled by three simple rules:

 1. Separation - avoid crowding neighbours (short range repulsion)
 2. Alignment - steer towards average heading of neighbours
 3. Cohesion - steer towards average position of neighbours (long range attraction)

Also added multiple options for testing:
- Normal mouse click, creates a single white bot, that flocks with other white bots.
- One team, creating 100 bots of one team.
- Two teams, creating 100 bots of two different teams.
- Flee Mouse, Option for interactive Mouse. Chase bots with the mouse.
   - Clicking the mouse creates a Hunter, hunting bots and turning them to hunters. (Only active while interactive Mouse.)
- Formation option, enabling full mesh between bots of the same team.
- Extra details option, showing stats and vectors.

- Reset, resets the website and canvas.
